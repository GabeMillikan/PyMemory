# PyMemory

A python wrapper for ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory.

The intention is to make it dead simple to read ctype structures from memory.

I am actively working on this project (as of May 24, 2020).

## Notes
 - The "CPP_equivalent" folder contains the code equivalent to that of PyMemory, but it is written in C++
 - The "OLD" folder is my previous attempts at creating the same project, however those were rushed and i had much less experience. This project (when completed) should be easier to understand, and have better code
 - The "user.py" file is an example use case
